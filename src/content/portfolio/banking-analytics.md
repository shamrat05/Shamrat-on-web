## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze performance metrics across 551+ banking outlets. The goal was to provide real-time insights for strategic decision-making and identify areas for operational improvement.

### Key Features

*   **Real-time Data Integration:** Connected to live banking databases for up-to-the-minute reporting.
*   **Performance Metrics:** Visualized key performance indicators (KPIs) such as transaction volume, account openings, and customer satisfaction scores.
*   **Geographic Analysis:** Mapped outlet performance across 62 districts to identify regional trends.

### The Challenge

The primary challenge was consolidating data from disparate sources and presenting it in a user-friendly format for non-technical stakeholders.

### The Solution

I utilized Power Query for data transformation and created an intuitive interactive dashboard with drill-down capabilities, allowing users to explore data at both macro and micro levels.

### Results

*   **20% Increase** in operational efficiency by identifying underperforming outlets.
*   **Faster Decision Making:** Reduced reporting time from days to minutes.
