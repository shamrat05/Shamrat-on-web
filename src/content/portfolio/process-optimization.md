## Overview

I led a strategic initiative to streamline operational workflows for 551+ agent banking outlets. The existing manual processes were causing delays and compliance risks.

### Approach

*   **Workflow Auditing:** Mapped out all existing processes to identify bottlenecks.
*   **Automation:** Implemented automation tools for routine reporting and compliance checks.
*   **Training:** Conducted workshops for field officers on the new standard operating procedures (SOPs).

### Impact

*   **25% Improvement** in processing efficiency.
*   **Zero** critical compliance violations in the following audit cycle.
