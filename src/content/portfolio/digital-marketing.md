## Project Overview

Leading the marketing initiative for a major metal industry player, I crafted a multi-channel digital strategy to increase brand awareness and drive sales for a new line of cookware products.

### Strategy

1.  **Market Research:** Conducted in-depth competitor analysis and customer surveys.
2.  **Content Marketing:** Launched a targeted blog and social media campaign focusing on healthy cooking.
3.  **Paid Advertising:** Managed optimized Google Ads and Facebook Ad campaigns.

### Outcome

The campaign resulted in a **15% increase in online sales** within the first quarter and significantly improved social media engagement metrics.
